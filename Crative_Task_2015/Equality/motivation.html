        <h3>Letter of Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since I decided to work in the educational sector I enjoyed to be with people whether I’ve been with children, juveniles, adults or elderly. I collected pedagogical experience along the way, that I can utilise in my projects.  
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for design, software development and programming grew stronger. So much so that I come to the point that I’d love to work in mobile creative world.
        </p>
        <p>I set my focus on the newest programming and mockup languages to build up-to-date styled apps and websites. Constantly learning and expanding my knowledge is great fun for me. This striving for aesthetics, innovation and constant progression is shaping my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming chanced how I think and it combines problem solving with my experience. I find this dynamic environment in mobile software engineering immensely appealing. To start with a blank sheet, designing an application from scratch evokes creativity in me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To study at Hyper Island would greatly accelerate my journey to become an app developer. I see this vocational school as a network of students, alumni and teachers as well as a direct connection to the corporate world.
        </p>
        <p>Contacts that would result in once in a lifetime chances is what I’ll seek there. Agility in manufacturing ideas and capability in picking the successful ones is knowledge I wish to gain. I believe that I’d find that at Hyper Island.
